# odin-recipes-again
Second revision of the course material, i will finish this time.

I'm putting together a recipe book. I have done some of the other framework, see my other repo, but I'm going through this again to make sure I haven't missed anything while I learn how to do front end development. The goal of this project is to combine HTML, CSS and potentially a little bit of java script so I have a functioning webpage of my favourite recipes. By the end I should be able to competently put together this creative work so I can use these skills for other projects.
