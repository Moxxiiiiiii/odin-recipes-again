            <p>So before we get into this, I've started making another recipe book that's made it to git. This is basically my second attempt at this project for the time being, a way of basically "refreshing" my knowledge on the subject since it's been a while. CSS has its complexities, and it's been good to revise it so far. I hope to surpass where I was, and work more on my other recipe book too once I figure out some java scripting nonsense.</p>
