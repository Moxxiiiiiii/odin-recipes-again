        <h2>So, what is this delicious stirfry?</h2>
        <p>Simply put, this is an oily fried dish with a few veggies and beef thrown into the wok. Follow along and I'll show you how to make it!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Noodles of your choice</li>
            <li>Beef strips</li>
            <li>Capscium</li>
            <li>Green Beans</li>
            <li>Bean Sprouts</li>
            <li>Daikon</li>
            <li>Bok Choy</li>
            <li>Chilli</li>
            <li>Bay Leaf</li>
            <li>Sesame Seeds</li>
            <li>Sesame Oil</li>
            <li>Spices of your choosing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by boiling the noodles of your choice</li>
            <li>Next, begin slicing the chillis and simmering them in the pan with sesame oil for 3 minutes over low to medium heat.</li>
            <li>While that simmers, cut the vegetables to your preferred proportion size</li>
            <li>Next, turn up the heat to medium and begin to brown the strips</li>
            <li>Once meat is browned slightly, add the cut up vegetables and season with whatever spices you prefer - I usually stick with some soy sauce, honey and some magi seasoning if I'm lazy.</li>
            <li>Turn heat up to high and continuously stir the vegetables adding in the noodles and more spices/sauces if the flavour is weak.</li>
            <li>Once the vegetables have been browned in sesame oil and the noodles have been cooked into the sauce, take off heat and serve with sesame seeds</li>
        </ol>
